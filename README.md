# Predictive-modelling-with-Python

This is a predictive modelling project using Python.

03_HLC_Wrangling: This is the first step to analyse the capstone project data to explore data structure, variables, data integrity, missingness and correlation between variables.  There are eight datasets in total for this project â€“ two are the main home-loan applications with target variable (train) and without target variable (test), and we analyse these two data in this stage.
